#+title: Nim + SystemVerilog + VPI
#+author: Kaushal Modi

This repo contains SystemVerilog VPI examples that I found in the
wild, translated to Nim, and then many examples of my own that show
the Nim/SystemVerilog interface via VPI.

* Requirements
User needs to have access to some SystemVerilog simulator supporting
VPI, like Cadence Xcelium.
* Versions tested
- Cadence Xcelium :: 20.09-s09
- OS :: CentOS 7.6
- Nim :: 1.5.1 as of 2021-04-30 Fri.
